_ - Frustum culling
_ - Batch by shader and material
X - Fix camera ztilt bug where it keeps pointing up
X - Shadow mapping
_ - shadow cascades
_ - hdri, tonemapping, bloom
X - phys wireframe view
_ - cook torrance lighting
_ - baked lighting
_ - asset compiler
_ - instancing, static combining meshes (remember we want to frustum cull so that should be a large consideration if we statically combine. Probably just instance for now)
_ - build up draw calls in a seperate thread
X - Raycast against boxes and draw intersection point
_ - Player capsule & movement phys
_ - Animation & skeleton import
_ - raw input for mouse
_ - keep cursor inside the screen
_ - prevent crashing & assets when things are zero scale, just skip drawing them instead
_ - minimize crashes engine
_ - phys acceleration bvh (probably don't use an octree since we allow overlapping bb colliders)
X - sphere physics
_ - gpu particles (should support shader hotloading)
X - click on phys to center flycam
X - Debug draw line
_ - Load all the meshes in the buffer one time, rather than creating a unique mesh per drawnode
_ - normal mapping
_ - Figure out how we're gonna deal with the fact that linked blender prefabs will require re-exporting all levels when one of the prefabs changes. (maybe some sort of "linked prefab markup", so it's a normal linked prefab in the blender scene, but we dump with info about where the prefab really came from)
X - timescaling (pg up/pg down)
X - implement += -= for points, vectors and vec4s
_ - fix issue where sphere hitting near the edge of box can get pushed out in the wrong direction (potentially sweep a capsule from the start to the end and find the intersection point that way). Or maybe something where we pick the face that puts us closest to where we came from or something
_ - Implement continuous sphere collision detection. If a sphere moves more than .25 it's radius kick on the continuous detection
_ - Support pausing without crashing
_ - Add a "reload the scene" 'r' button
_ - figure out what's up with stair collision
_ - Fixed update. Get things like phys and character movement (but not camera movement) running in a fixed update function
_ - Put common shader structs into a header
_ - Text wrapping (nice when trying to show long shader errors)
X - fix lock that occurs when retracting or extending.
