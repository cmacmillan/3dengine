_ - Frustum culling
_ - Batch by shader and material
X - Fix camera ztilt bug where it keeps pointing up
X - Shadow mapping
_ - shadow cascades
_ - hdri, tonemapping, bloom
_ - phys wireframe view
_ - cook torrance lighting
_ - baked lighting
_ - asset compiler
_ - instancing, static combining meshes (remember we want to frustum cull so that should be a large consideration if we statically combine. Probably just instance for now)
_ - build up draw calls in a seperate thread
X - Raycast against boxes and draw intersection point
_ - Player capsule & movement phys
_ - Animation & skeleton import
_ - raw input for mouse
_ - keep cursor inside the screen
_ - prevent crashing & assets when things are zero scale, just skip drawing them instead
_ - minimize crashes engine
_ - phys acceleration bvh (probably don't use an octree since we allow overlapping bb colliders)
_ - sphere physics
_ - gpu particles (should support shader hotloading)
_ - click on phys to center flycam
_ - Debug draw line
_ - Load all the meshes in the buffer one time, rather than creating a unique mesh per drawnode
_ - normal mapping
